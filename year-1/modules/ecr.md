# Ethics and Commercial Reasoning

## Rationale

Students engaged in business in either the private or public sector should understand codes of moral conduct and expect that their superiors and those whom they manage also follow acceptable standards of morality and uphold ethical standards, particularly in relation to the development and deployment of new technology.

In order to appreciate this inescapable component of work experience it is important that students have an appreciation of the status of moral and ethical statements and of their rationale and applicability. Such an understanding must rest on sound theoretical foundations which can be used by the student to justify their moral standpoint. It is also important that students understand how to apply these moral and ethical codes in the workplace as well as their personal lives.
