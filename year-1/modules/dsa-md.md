# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Rationale

The implementation phase of software development requires practical competence in program construction and knowledge of the performance characteristics and the theoretical limits of algorithms, In this module, the use of classical abstract data types, algorithms that operate on abstract data types, and the analysis of algorithm performance for different data structures are considered. The module provides the necessary foundation in data and storage structures for all computing streams. In particular, structures and algorithms for both the internal and the external storage of data are presented. At the same time, the module provides the student with the opportunity to reinforce and enhance their programming skills.

## Aims

* To develop a student's algorithmic programming skills.
* To introduce students to the classical abstract data types used in large-scale software systems.
* To introduce students to algorithms that process abstract data types and that form potential building blocks for software systems.
* To introduce students to methods for the estimation of algorithm execution performance and memory usage.
