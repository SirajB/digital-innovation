## Rationale
The study of programming and the development of programming skills are central to any undergraduate course in computing. Traditionally, software has been developed using an algorithmic programming language implemented using top-down design and a structured approach. Students must, therefore, become skilled in the use of one such language. In recent years, there has been a move towards greater use of languages, which facilitate an object-oriented approach. The language chosen, therefore, should be such that it will be a vehicle for the development of skills and concepts, which are transferable to any other algorithmic language and at the same time, facilitate the transition to an object-oriented approach to software design. 

## Aims
* To provide students with expertise in the design and implementation of algorithms and in the choice, design and implementation of appropriate data types and simple data structures for the efficient solution of problems.

* To provide an understanding of structured and introductory object oriented programming which will provide the ability to choose and devise a design, and implement and test efficient solutions to complex programming problems.

* To provide an understanding of the fundamental concepts upon which object-orientation is based and the skills to implement those concepts in programming language Java.

## Intended Learning Outcomes

#### A. Knowledge and understanding
At the end of the module, learners will be expected to:
* A1 : Have a sound understanding of the basic principles of object-oriented and imperative programming styles.
* A2: Display an appreciation of the individual stages of the program development lifecycle.
* A3: Define algorithmic solutions using the programming constructs of sequence, selection, repetition and sub-routines.

#### B. Cognitive skills
At the end of the module learners will be expected to:
* B1: Formulate algorithmic solutions to problem statements using a structured approach to problem solving.
* B2: Translate algorithmic solutions into formal software solutions utilising Java programming language.
* B3:  Verify syntactic and semantic correctness of a program and how it meets the original problem specification.

#### C. Practical and professional skills
At the end of the module, learners will be expected to:
* C1: Load, edit, compile, test and execute programs in Java
* C2: Develop software that is well structured, well documented and readable.
* C3: Trace the execution of simple sections of code and determine the outcome for a given input.

#### D Key transferable skills 
At the end of the module, learners will be expected to:
* D1: Demonstrate ability to analyse and decompose complex problems and communicate the solution.
* D2: Demonstrate ability to research suitable resources of information regarding a particular programming problem.
* D3: Evaluate possible algorithmic solutions and select the most appropriate.

## Assessment 
The course will be assessed through a practical assignment that requires the student to take a written specification for a piece of software and design and implement an appropriate solution. The assignment requires analysis of problems that meet the given specification; the design and development of computer-based solutions to solve problems and the submission of a report. This assessment will be in two parts. Feedback will be provided on the analysis. The assignment will assess the studentsâ€™ competence in object oriented programming skills, documentation and explanation. This assignment is weighted as 100% of the module.
