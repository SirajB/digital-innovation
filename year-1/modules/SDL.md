# System Development Life Cycle

## Rationale
Most IT departments or software development companies, irrespective of their size, have a formal set of procedures for initiating and developing new business information systems. This is often termed as System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). SDLC is an essential process of developing software solutions within organisations. This module introduces students to the systems development life cycles and processes. It shows how object-oriented analysis and design techniques can be used early in the life cycle and how project management and quality control techniques can be applied throughout the life cycle. Software tools are used to support the modeling and management of systems.  Methods, and how techniques fit into them, are introduced. 

## Aims
This module aims to:
* Introduce the student to the key phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC) including requirements engineering, analysis, design, basic development and testing and demonstrate understanding of alternative SDLC lifecycle models.
* Introduce the student to the concepts and tools needed to successfully design and build database-centric application programs using object-oriented and traditional methods and project management techniques.
* Enable students to communicate software requirements and designs clearly and effectively.
* Enable students to describe role of the security analyst in the Systems Development Life Cycle

## Intended Learning Outcomes

#### A. Knowledge and understanding
*At the end of the module, learners will be expected to:*
* A1 : Explain the various stages and associated roles, of the traditional software development lifecycle from feasibility/investigation through end‐of‐maintenance/support 
* A2: Describe the role of modern methodologies in the software development process.
* A3. Identify the need for security architecture and its relevance to systems, service continuity and reliability.

#### B. Cognitive skills
*At the end of the module learners will be expected to:*
* B1: Reflect on appropriate development methodologies. 
* B2:  Evaluate the techniques used by a Project Manager to schedule activities and resources.
* B3: Evaluate current state of software security and create a plan for dealing with it throughout the life cycle.

#### C. Practical and professional skills
At the end of the module, learners will be expected to:
* C1: Use object oriented systems analysis and design techniques to model simple systems. 
* C2: Use project management techniques to plan a project. 
* C3: To develop software in a consistent and efficient way with a demonstrable & standards-compliant security quality, in line with the organizational risks.

#### D Key transferable skills 
At the end of the module, learners will be expected to:
* D1: Decompose complex requirements in a problem-solving exercise.
* D2: Use personal initiative and communications skills throughout the process.
* D3: Illustrate how an organization’s employment policies and practices can support the information security effort.

## Assessment 
#### Course work (50%)
This assessment takes the form of a written assignment, accounting for 50% of the final mark. Students will typically be able to demonstrate competence in the use of industry-standard software in the modeling of a system for a given scenario. 

#### Written examination [50%]
Students undertake an examination composed of compulsory questions, set on each of the major areas of the module and a choice of others from a given selection. All questions are closed-book in nature.
