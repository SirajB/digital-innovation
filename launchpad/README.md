Launchpad is an intensive eight week programme that fuses the rigour of a university degree with the energy of a coding bootcamp.

Over the course of Launchpad you will work closely with your peers and forge a network that will last you a lifetime.

It's an intense learning experience that will see you develop the skills that'll help you succeed in the workplace.

Buckle up!
