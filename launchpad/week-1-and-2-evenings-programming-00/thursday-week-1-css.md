# Thursday Week 1: CSS

View the page source of. this early version of Yahoo. This was built before CSS was invented.

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/yahoo-1994/\",\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":\"Yahoo - A Guide to WWW\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://kottke.org/favicon.ico\",\"aspectRatio\":0}}" %}

Style instructions littered through the HTML makes the site less accessible. It's bad for screen readers, and means users have less control over their experience.

CSS is used to style our HTML:

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction\_to\_CSS/How\_CSS\_works\",\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":\"How CSS works\",\"description\":\"CSS \(Cascading Style Sheets\) allows you to create great looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, how the browser turns HTML into a Document Object Model \(DOM\), how CSS is applied to parts of the DOM, some very basic syntax examples, and what code is used to actually include our CSS in our web page.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/favicon144.e7e21ca263ca.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/opengraph-logo.72382e605ce3.png\",\"width\":600,\"height\":600,\"aspectRatio\":1}}" %}

Install the [web developer toolbar](%20https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=web+developer+toolbar). Use it to disable CSS on your favourite website. What happens?

Now go to CSS Zen Garden. View the page source. The HTML is always the same. Load in the different designs. All that's changing is the CSS

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"http://www.csszengarden.com/\",\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":\"CSS Zen Garden: The Beauty of CSS Design\",\"description\":\"A demonstration of what can be accomplished visually through CSS-based design.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"http://www.csszengarden.com/favicon.ico\",\"aspectRatio\":0},\"caption\":\"\"}" %}

Once you are happy with the idea of what CSS is, continue with the CSS section of freeCodeCamp:

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css\",\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":\"Basic CSS \| freeCodeCamp\",\"description\":\"Learn to code with free online courses, programming projects, and interview preparation for developer jobs.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://learn.freecodecamp.org/assets/android-chrome-192x192.png\",\"width\":192,\"height\":192,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/curriculum-diagram-full.jpg\",\"width\":1400,\"height\":1400,\"aspectRatio\":1}}" %}
