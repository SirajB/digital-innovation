# Monday & Tuesday Week 2 - Command line tasks

The command line cheat sheet might help you with some of the tasks below. It's a useful resource to get familiar with anyway!

{% page-ref page="../../guides/command-line-cheat-sheet.md" %}

## Groups

1. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm comfortable exploring the command line‚Äù
2. ‚ÄúThere was lots of new stuff yesterday and I struggled with it a little, but I'm excited to get stuck in and start trying it out for myself‚Äù
3. ‚ÄúI felt a bit lost yesterday - I don't want to start exploring the command line myself until I have a firmer grasp of the concepts‚Äù

{% hint style="info" %}
Most of these questions will require you to research on the internet, and try stuff out in your terminal. You're not expected to know this stuff already! **As you go through these exercises, start to create your own "cheat sheet" guide to terminal commands by answering the questions.**

## 1. Listing files

We saw how to list files using the `ls` command.

* Try running `ls -l`. What's different?
* Try running `ls -a`. What's different?
* What are these suffixes to the ls command called? \(They have a specific name when they start with a `-` sign.\)
* How can you combine the `-l` and the `-a` for the same `ls` command \(there are two ways\)?
* Where might you find a list of all of the options available for the `ls` command?
* Why do some of these options start with a single `-` and some start with a double dash \(`--`\)? Is there a convention?

## 2. Manipulating Files

We already know that we can create directories \(folders\) with the `mkdir` command, and we can create files with `touch`. But how do we move files around once they've been created?

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's really easy to get lost when you're new to using the terminal. `pwd` and `ls` are your map and compass  when navigating your filesystem - use them regularly! üó∫

Create a file structure that looks like this, using only the command line:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2018-10-09-at-14.55.25.png)

* Assuming you are in the `project` folder, how can you move `file1.txt` to the `four` folder, without changing directory?
* Now change into the `two` folder \(`cd two`\). How can you move `file2.txt` into the `two` folder \(the one you are in\)?
* Now copy `file2.txt` into folder `five`.
* Work out how to delete `file1.txt`
* How do you delete folder `three`? Try it.
* How do you rename files? Try renaming one of them.
* How do you handle file paths with spaces in them?
* How would you list all the files ending in `.txt` in a directory?
* How would you remove all the files ending in `.txt` in a directory?

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be careful when you're deleting stuff - when you're using the terminal, there's no Recycling Bin or undo. Double check your commands before you run them!

To open a file or folder in VSCode, you can use the `code` command. To open the current directory, the command would be `code .`

1. Change directory back to `project`
2. Use `code my-file.txt` to open a new file in your editor called `my-file.txt`
3. Add some content! Write your name and how you feel about the terminal. Remember to save the file!
4. Find out what the `cat` command does, and use it on that new file

## 3. Get your website running locally

Do the following using only your command line and text editor.

1. Create a `projects` folder to store all of your code projects.
2. Create a "project folder" for your website.
3. Move your website files into this folder **OR** if you're using Thimble, create all the files you need and copy the content from Thimble into the files
4. Install `serve`, a tool for running websites locally. Use `npm install --global serve`
5. Start `serve` in your website folder and open the URL it gives you - use[ the serve documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve#usage) to help
6. Find out how to stop the server
7. Find out what a http server is
8. Find out what `localhost` means

## 4. What are dotfiles, and how do they work?

* What are dotfiles?
* What's the difference between a dotfile and any other file?
* What are they used for?
* What dotfiles and dotfolders do you have in your `~`? What do you think they do? Have a look at some of them with `cat` or `code`.
* Edit your `.bashrc` and create an **alias** - you may need to do some research to find out what this is and how you do it. Example aliases you might create
  * Something to open the current folder 
  * A way to avoid accidentally `rm`'ing things \(look at the `-i` flag\)
  * A way to switch to your desktop quickly

## 5. Things to try at home...

Customize the functionality of your shell!

* Use `.bash_profile`. Use the internet.
* Don't just copy/paste without understanding.
* Think about why you are doing it
* Talk to each other on Slack
