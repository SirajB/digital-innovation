The command line cheat sheet might help you with some of the tasks below. It's a useful resource to get familiar with anyway!

{% page-ref page="../../guides/command-line-cheat-sheet.md" %}

## 1. Some questions to start...

> * Practice using the basic shell commands we've just learned.
> * How do you handle file paths with spaces in them?
> * How would you list all the files ending in `.txt` in a directory?
> * How would you remove all the files ending in `.txt` in a directory?

## 2. Get your website running locally

Do the following using only your command line and text editor.

1. Create a `projects` folder to store all of your code projects.
2. Create a "project folder" for your website.
3. Move your website files into this folder **OR** if you're using Thimble, create all the files you need and copy the content from Thimble into the files
4. Install `serve`, a tool for running websites locally. Use `npm install --global serve`
5. Start `serve` in your website folder and open the URL it gives you - use[ the serve documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve#usage) to help
6. Find out how to stop the server
7. Find out what a http server is

## 3. What are dotfiles, and how ho they work?

* What are dotfiles?
* What's the difference between a dotfile and any other file?
* What are they used for?
* What dotfiles and dotfolders do you have in your `~`? What do you think they do? Have a look at some of them with `cat` or `code`.
* Edit your `.bashrc` and create an **alias** - you may need to do some research to find out what this is and how you do it. Example aliases you might create
  * Something to open the current folder 
  * A way to avoid accidentally `rm`'ing things \(look at the `-i` flag\)
  * A way to switch to your desktop quickly

## 4. Things to try at home...

Customize the functionality of your shell!
