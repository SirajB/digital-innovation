The command line cheat sheet might help you with some of the tasks below. It's a useful resource to get familiar with anyway!

{% page-ref page="../../guides/command-line-cheat-sheet.md" %}

## 1. Some questions to start...

> * Practice using the basic shell commands we've just learned.
> * How do you handle file paths with spaces in them?
> * How would you list all the files ending in `.txt` in a directory?
> * How would you remove all the files ending in `.txt` in a directory?

## 2. Get your website running locally



## 3. What are dotfiles, and how ho they work?

* What are dotfiles?
* What's the difference between a dotfile and any other file?
* What are they used for?
* What dotfiles and dotfolders do you have in your `~`? What do you think they do? Have a look at some of them with `cat` or `code`.
* Edit your `.bashrc` and create an **alias** - you may need to do some research to find out what this is and how you do it. Example aliases you might create
  * Something to open the current folder 
  * A way to avoid accidentally `rm`'ing things \(look at the `-i` flag\)
  * A way to switch to your desktop quickly

## 4. Things to try at home...

Customize the functionality of your shell!

* Use `.bash_profile`. Use the internet.
* Don't just copy/paste without understanding.
