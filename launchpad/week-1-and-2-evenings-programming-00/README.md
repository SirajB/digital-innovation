# Week 1 & 2 evenings: Programming 00

We want to ease you into coding. We believe that the best way to get into coding is to learn how to build websites.

You will start by doing HTML & CSS. These languages allow you to structure your content \(HTML\) and design it \(CSS\). You will be learning to write code i.e. getting to grips with the brackets and braces of syntax, but HTML and CSS aren't "programming languages" in the traditional sense; you won't be writing loops or functions or anything like that.

In parallel to HTML & CSS, we will start to explore proper programming using visual tools like Blockly. These allow you to get your head around programming concepts without the fiddlyness of writing syntax getting in the way.

Over the course of this short programme you will learn to build websites, learn the universal principles of programming, and also learn key development tools and techniques such as using the command line \(CLI\) and the version control system Git.

It's a fun, accessible introduction to coding that will see you design and build your own website, and deploy it to the open web for the world to enjoy \(or not ;\)

### **Website brief**

* a single page personal portfolio website
* it should explain who you are, where you work, and why you’re completing a digital innovation apprenticeship at Ada
* you should use HTML and CSS
* include at least one image and at least one link

Extension:

* add video
* add more pages
* make your website available on the public web!

### **Groups**

1. “I’m comfortable with HTML and CSS, I know how I’m going to make this website”
2. “I’m struggling a bit with freecodecamp but feel ok about it. I’m not sure how to make this website, but I think I can figure it out with a little help”
3. “I’m feeling overwhelmed by everything and don’t have a clue where to even start”
