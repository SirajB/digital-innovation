# Wednesday Week 2: More Website Work!

## 1. Get your website running locally \(if you haven't already\)

Do the following using only your command line and text editor.

1. Create a `projects` folder to store all of your code projects.
2. Create a "project folder" for your website.
3. Move your website files into this folder **OR** if you're using Thimble, create all the files you need and copy the content from Thimble into the files
4. Install `serve`, a tool for running websites locally. Use `npm install --global serve`
5. Start `serve` in your website folder and open the URL it gives you - use [the serve documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve#usage) to help
6. Find out how to stop the server
7. Find out what a http server is
8. Find out what `localhost` means

## 2. Finish your Portfolio Website

## 3. Add a Learning Blog

{% hint style="warning" %}
Keep this **simple**. Don't overcomplicate and stick to plain HTML and CSS.
{% endhint %}

This is a place for you to track your learning and record your progress through launchpad. We'd love it if you could update this at the end of every week with your reflections

1. Create a new HTML page, linked to from your homepage.
2. Add an article for the first week of launchpad. This should include a title, date and content. Ideally, it should include some photos.
3. The article should be well marked-up with semantic, accessible HTML. Research this before diving into code - what's the best element to use for each part of the post \(and for the post itself\).
4. Once you are happy with your markup, use CSS to style the page ðŸŽ¨
