The cables already have existing protective materials designed to shelter them from the various dangers of the environment, but will now be coated with a \'Kevlar-like\' material to provide even more protection.\\n\\nFibre-optic cables are made of strands of glass, and are thus much less durable than copper cables.

The principle of universal accessibility permeates everything we do at Ada

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction\_to\_HTML\",\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":\"Introduction to HTML\",\"description\":\"At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document \(Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?\), structure a document into logical sections \(Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?\), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these, and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/favicon144.e7e21ca263ca.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/opengraph-logo.72382e605ce3.png\",\"width\":600,\"height\":600,\"aspectRatio\":1}}" %}

The exercise for this session was to work in pairs and complete as much as possible of the Basic HTML and HTML5 section of freeCodeCamp

Make sure you cover the basics. Those with existing experience should browse the list of topics for something you are unfamiliar with, and work from there.
