# Week 1 & 2 evenings: Programming 00

We want to ease you into coding. We believe that the best way to get into coding is to learn how to build websites.

You will start by doing HTML & CSS. These languages allow you to structure your content \(HTML\) and design it \(CSS\). You will be learning to write code i.e. getting to grips with the brackets and braces of syntax, but HTML and CSS aren't "programming languages" in the traditional sense; you won't be writing loops or functions or anything like that.

In parallel to HTML & CSS, we will start to explore proper programming using visual tools like Blockly. These allow you to get your head around programming concepts without the fiddlyness of writing syntax getting in the way.

Over the course of this short programme you will learn to build websites, learn the universal principles of programming, and also learn key development tools and techniques such as using the command line \(CLI\) and the version control system Git.

It's a fun, accessible introduction to coding that will see you design and build your own website, and deploy it to the open web for the world to enjoy \(or not ;\)
