# Week 1 & 2 evenings: Programming 00

We want to ease you into coding. We believe that the best way to get into coding is to learn how to build websites.

You will start by doing HTML & CSS. These languages allow you to structure your content \(HTML\) and design it \(CSS\). You will be learning to write code i.e. getting to grips with the brackets and braces of syntax, but HTML and CSS aren't "programming languages" in the traditional sense; you won't be writing loops or functions or anything like that.

In parallel to HTML & CSS, we will start to explore proper programming using visual tools like Blockly. These allow you to get your head around programming concepts without the fiddlyness of writing syntax getting in the way.

Over the course of this short programme you will learn to build websites, learn the universal principles of programming, and also learn key development tools and techniques such as using the command line \(CLI\) and the version control system Git.

It's a fun, accessible introduction to coding that will see you design and build your own website, and deploy it to the open web for the world to enjoy \(or not ;\)

### Introduction to Git and GitHub

**Slides**: [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s5kmc3J7HnS19qrdlpnzV3as0Hx0Z6_Onr4HHwoaFR8).

Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. You're going to be using it to collaborate on code, and also to manage your own code - git is a core skill for software developers.

GitHub is an online social code-sharing tool, based on Git. Here's how they describe themselves:

> _**GitHub**_ brings together the world's largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better software.

We'll give you a quick introduction to Git and Github, but we won;t cover everything. Later in the course, we'll cover branching, merging, rebasing and pull requests. If you want to learn more on your own, here are some good resources:

## Introduction to the Command Line

Learning to use the command line is a crucial skill for developers, and is not as scary as you might think. Here are some useful resources, once you've had your introduction:
