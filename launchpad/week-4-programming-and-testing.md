## Day 1: Consolidation and Object Literals

The week will start with a day of consolidation: you can work on the workshops from last week, or start to work on your assignment. There's also a new workshop on JavaScript Object Literals today.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you missed this workshop on Monday, it's not **absolutely crucial** that you finish it. Completing the **OOP** and **TDD** workshops is far more important. You can always revisit this at ~~~~a later date!

## Day 5: File Read/Write & Consolidation

Day five contains two workshops. The first is an introduction to reading and writing to files, which should take about 2 hours to complete \(excluding the extension work\).

The second workshop consolidates everything we've learned so far and includes some screencasts recapping test-driven object-oriented programming.
