# Module Descriptor

### Rationale

Database technologies have a wide range of applications and represent a core component of information systems. They are also the preferred storage method for large multi-user software applications. This course presents the fundamental principles of database systems. It provides students with good understanding of database design and implementation and a practical experience in using database management systems. It focuses on design, implementation and querying of relational database systems.

### Aims

_The aims of the module are to:_

* Address the fundamental properties and requirements of relational databases management systems.
* Provide a rationale and context for data modeling and management within an organisation.
* Enable students to gain practical experience in the design and implementation of database systems using database management systems.
* Provide an insight into recent developments in database technologies.

### Learning Outcomes

#### A. Knowledge and understanding

_At the end of the module, learners will be expected to:_

* A1: Have an understanding of the fundamental principles of database systems in general and relational database systems in particular.
* A2: Be able to discuss the techniques and methodologies used in the design and implementation of database systems.
* A3: Demonstrate knowledge and awareness of recent developments in database technologies.

#### B. Cognitive skills

_At the end of the module learners will be expected to:_

* B1: Analyse a business situation and produce related data representation models.
* B2: Analyse and specify appropriate requirements for the design and implementation of a database system.
* B3: Evaluate different techniques and approaches used in the design and development of database solutions.

#### C. Practical and professional skills

_At the end of the module, learners will be expected to:_

* C1: Demonstrate the ability to apply database design and implementation techniques in the development of a database system.
* C2: Demonstrate the ability to develop conceptual, logical and physical data models for a real world scenario. 
* C3: Demonstrate the ability to implement and manipulate a database system using a commercial relational database management system \(RDBMS\) and SQL.
* C4: Adhere to recognised standards when developing a database system.

#### D. Key Transferrable Skills

_At the end of the module, learners will be expected to:_

* D1: Adopt a methodical approach to analyse, solve complex problems and writing reports.
* D2: Communicate and document solutions for database implementations.
* D3: Adhere to industry guidelines when developing database systems.
* D4: Integrate recognised enterprise wide principles into database system development.

### Assessment

#### Practical skills assessment \[50%\]

This coursework will consist of the design and development of a database application and will require a deeper understanding of database design principles and implementation techniques.

#### Written examination \[50%\]

Students undertake an examination composed of one compulsory question and a choice of others from a given selection. All questions are closed-book in nature.
