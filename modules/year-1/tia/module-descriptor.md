# Module Descriptor

## Testing, Integrated and Automated

### Rationale

Computer software is present almost everywhere. The impact of software failure is often quite considerably so reliability and robustness is paramount when developing software. The importance of effective testing methodologies for quality assurance in the software industry has increased substantially in recent years. This module introduces concepts and techniques for testing software and assuring its quality. Methods for software testing and quality assurance are integrated into all phases of the software development process and it also extends to other aspects such as systems and hardware development. Testing is crucial in the process of developing software and this module provides with the principles for conducting software testing in a systematic and effective manner.

### Aims

* To study fundamental concepts in software testing, including software testing objectives, process, criteria, strategies, and methods.
* To discuss various software testing issues and solutions in software unit test; integration, regression, and system testing. 
* To learn how to planning a test project, design test cases and data, conduct testing operations, manage software problems and defects, generate a testing report.
* To expose the advanced software testing topics, such as object-oriented software testing methods, and component-based software testing issues, challenges, and solutions.
* To gain software testing experience by applying software testing knowledge and methods to practice-oriented software testing projects.
* To understand software test automation problems and solutions.
