# Digital Innovation Apprenticeship

Welcome to the Digital Innovation GitBook.

This GitBook should be used hand in hand with your Aptem learning plan, as it contains all the lecture slides and workshop guides for the weeks you are with us.

Before beginning a module make sure to check for any suggested reading in the resources section. Up-to-date weekly timetables will be available at least 48 hours in advance.

Please remember: we are not here to be ordinary, we are here to be awesome.
