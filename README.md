# Digital Innovation Apprenticeship

Dear Apprentice,

Welcome to Ada! Congratulations on being offered a role with your new employer and enrolling as a Higher Level Apprentice. The next 24 months as you study your Foundation Degree with Ada and complete your initial employment will be a stretching and testing rollercoaster in which we look forward to pushing you to excel and learn not only to be a highly competent entry-level software engineer but also a rounded, reflective professional well prepared to blaze a trail through your organisation as a digital pioneer.

At Ada we focus on five values: Rigour, Resilience, Creativity, Curiosity and Collaboration. We strive to ensure all our staff, students and apprentices embody these values as well as the employers and other organisations that we work with. Coupled with the mindsets and skillsets you will learn on your course, we believe that if you can embody these values in your work that you will differentiate yourself as a leader.

As a member of this cohort of apprentices at Ada, you are in a unique position. It is rare to be involved in something new, the opportunity comes along just a handful of times at most in any person’s life. I hope you rise to the challenge of helping us shape and improve the apprenticeship programme for future cohorts - only your feedback can help ensure this is the case so please share it with us, even if it is not what you think we want to hear. You are also a role model to the younger students, many of whom are aspiring to be in the position you are now in, training and learning with your employer. Again, I know you will rise to this challenge just as you will in the future years of your career when you take on more responsibility – I hope you can find time to share your experiences and insights with students and staff as you progress.

Good luck with your studies. This guide should provide a useful point of reference throughout. Finally, please remember, ‘We are not here to be ordinary, we are here to be awesome.’
