#### Code.org

#### Codecademy

#### Codewars

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is a challenge site operating in many languages. Students complete Kata, which are ranked in difficulty from 8 kyu (the easiest) to 1 kyu (the most difficult)

#### Coursera

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) is a massively open online course repository. Check out [Creative Programming for Digital Media and Mobile Apps](https://www.coursera.org/learn/digitalmedia/), which uses Processing.js, an earlier attempt to adapt the Processing framework to Javascript.

#### CS50 

[CS50](http://cs50.tv/) is an introductory Computer Science course at Harvard, adapted by David J Malan to make it more accessible to all students regardless of whether they are interested in *majoring* in the subject. It jumps around from language to language, starting with Scratch and C before finally emerging into the enlightened age of Javascript. You can follow the lectures in High Definition video, in [Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDtN1mlvYx8&list=PLhQjrBD2T383bsZ9yG64-aPhg2M6FM0-O) or in [Virtual Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C8a6GBF8Bg). 

#### Free Code Camp

[Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) was started as a Repository with links to interesting courses, but developed into a project with a built in code editor and hundreds of exercises teaching you how to become a full-stack web developer. Don't be put off by the amount of hours supposedly required to complete each section; a lot of these are factored from the extensive projects. We recommend doing at least the exercises for the Responsive Web Design and Data Structures and Algorithms sections, and then coming back to other sections as you need them.

#### Kadenze

[Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/) is the quirky art school of Massively Open Online Courses, specialising in courses that teach you how to apply your coding knowledge to produce beautiful works of art, music, architecture and more.  Highly recommended is the amazing [Introduction to Programming for the Visual Arts with P5.js](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js), taught by the developer of P5, Lauren McCarthy, and Casey Reas, who developed the Processing language on which P5 is based.

#### Kaggle

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a learning environment and competition platform geared towards Machine Learning; as such, it's a really good place to learn [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python), Python's Data Manipulation library [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) (which is also useful for [Visualisation](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualisation)), [SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/sql) and [R](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/r). There are also plenty of [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to investigate, and [competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) with significant amounts of prize money and prestige attached.
