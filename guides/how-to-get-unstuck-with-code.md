# How to get unstuck with code

## 1: Try to figure things out on your own \(10-20 mins\)

1. **Stop.** Just stop writing code. Stopping is usually a good start. Step away from the keyboard.
2. **Identify your problem.** Does your code not work but you don't know why? Is your code doing something unexpected? Are you struggling to figure out how to start solving a particular problem
3. **Collect data.** Without information about your problem, you can't solve it. Are there any helpful error messages? What about logs? How can you change your program to give you more insight into what's happening? Try adding some `console.log` calls to your code. Can you use the debugger? Will a search engine help?
4. **Map your understanding.** You can't solve a problem with your code if you don't understand what's going on. Can you draw a diagram to clarify your understanding? Do you and your pairing partner have the same understanding of what's happening?
5. **Come up with a hypothesis.** This might be for a solution to your problem, or to verify an area of your understanding. You don't want to be just randomly trying things to see if something works - if you do, you might solve your problem without really understanding how, or just make things worse! This should be a **falsifiable statement** - something that you can prove true or false.
6. **Test your hypothesis.** Make the smallest possible change to your code to test your hypothesis. Did it work?
7. **Repeat.** Keep collecting data and testing hypotheses. You can often solve your problem or collect enough information that it becomes obvious this way.

## 2: Ask someone nearby \(5-15 mins\)

Ask someone nearby for help, and continue the process above with them involved. Often, a different perspective is all that's needed for a solution to suddenly become obvious.

## 3: Ask a coach

Once you've tried the above, you can ask a coach for some help. They'll try and point you in the right direction, but might avoid answering your question directly. They might refer you back to an earlier part of this process too! If you're interested, check out the guide doc that coaches should follow when you ask them for help:
