# Revision Tips & Staying Organised

As the launchpad progresses you'll find yourself learning faster and faster, and it can sometimes be hard to keep your head above the water. Here are some tips for keeping organised and revising what you've learned.

### Staying organised

* Get in the habit of checking your **email**, **calendar** and **Slack** every morning so there are no surprises for the day.
* Write a brief schedule for the day in your notebook or calendar, based on the schedule provided by the training staff. Also include any other meetings or stuff you have to do.
* Use a tool like [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) to capture interesting articles, including those from the \#resource channel on Slack. If you install it on your phone, you'll always have plenty of reading material in your pocket.
* Create a system for managing the work you've got on your plate. Google tasks or iOS reminders are pretty good, but a notebook also works. There are also more advanced tools like [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/), [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) etc. If this stuff is interesting to you, speak to **Danny**. He's a massive nerd about this stuff.
* If you have a lesson or lecture first-thing, aim to get in 10 minutes early so you're fully present when it starts. 

### Revising and revisiting what you've learned

Although you'll be given time during workshops to revise what you've learned, it's a good idea to go over things a little in your own time. It's totally down to you how you do this, but we've seen this work well before:

* **Take notes during the day**. You shouldn't try to write everything down \(you've always got google\). Instead, just note down headings for the stuff you've learned, along with a few notes for the bits you found hard to understand.
* **At the end of the day, read through the headings** - if there's anything you didn't get, add a task to your todo list to read up on it or ask a lecturer.
* **At the end of every week, quickly skim over your headings for the week** - is there anything that jumps out at you, or which you can't really remember? That's the stuff to read up on.
* **When you get some time, skim the headings from earlier weeks** - what do you remember clearly? What isn't so clear now? What makes more sense in light of what you've learned since? This is a good way to reinforce and connect your learning, and is a form of [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).  It's also a good way to see how far you've come!

### Practising what you've learned

Although revision is important, programming is a **practical skill**. While the workshops are designed so you have plenty of time to practice as you learnin, you might want to do some practical stuff in your own time. Here are some tips if you do:

* Keep a prioritised list of things you think you need to practice.
* Set yourself small, achievable [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) targets for your practice.
  * _"Practice git"_ **vs** _"Practice creating new git repos and making commits until I don't need to refer to the cheatsheet"_.
  * _"Do some functions"_ **vs** _"Practice writing functions until I can explain how they work to my housemate without hesitation"._
* Ask your lecturers for good resources.
* Make use of the many online tools available for short, focussed practice \(eg [ES6 Katas](http://es6katas.org/)\). We'll point you at some of these at appropriate times throughout the course.
* Keep a [pet project](https://medium.com/g33kchris-net/its-personal-the-purposes-of-the-pet-project-697b5c290cb8), and try to incorporate your new learning as you go. This might be your personal website, or it might be something else. Remember to keep this **simple**.

### Practicing and revising collaboratively

Practice and revision can be a lot more engaging if you do it collaboratively. Here are some ideas:

* Pair up on a pet project.
* Make some flash cards with terminal/git commands on them and use them to test each other.
* Review each others' code.
* If someone is struggling with a concept you understand, run a short workshop for them - you're always welcome to grab a TV or whiteboard if it's not being used. Maybe ask if anyone else wants to join in?
